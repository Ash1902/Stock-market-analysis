# Stock-market-analysis
This project focuses on detecting, analyzing, and interpreting anomalies in stock market data to uncover potential investment opportunities and risks. By calculating Z-scores for stock prices and trading volumes, the project identifies significant deviations from the norm. These anomalies can signal important market events, such as a sudden spike in a stock's price due to positive news, indicating a potential investment opportunity, or an unexpected price drop that could warn of underlying issues or changes in market sentiment, highlighting a risk that investors need to manage. The analysis provides valuable insights for making informed investment decisions and managing financial risks effectively.
